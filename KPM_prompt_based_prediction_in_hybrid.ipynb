      "I used my own criteria to calculate the confidence score. Basically, I compared the topic and related words in the argument and kps. The maximum confidence score is 1 which means the argument exactly matches the kp. The minimum score is 0 which means argument has no relationship with the kp. Confidence score is a float between 0 and 1. The detailed explanation is as followed:\n",
      "\n",
      "- KP1 \"Women possess the same skills as men for effective combat performance.\" matches the argument that women should be allowed the same opportunities as men, including combat. So the confidence score is high. I give it 0.9.\n",
      "\n",
      "- KP2 \"Women possess the same capability as men in fulfilling combat roles.\" also has a high correlation with the argument, but slightly less than KP1 because \"capability\" is not clearly stated in the argument. Still, I give it a high score, 0.8.\n",
      "\n",
      "- KP3 \"Advocates for women's rights argue that equal rights should extend to combat roles in the military.\" is directly aligned with the argument made, so it gets a high score of 0.9.\n",
      "\n",
      "- KP4 \"Gender should not be a criterion for prohibitions in combat, instead the individual's physical capability determined by medical examination should be the deciding factor.\" is similar to the argument, arguing against gender-based prohibitions, but it's a little less direct than previous ones. So I give it 0.7.\n",
      "\n",
      "- KP5 \"Women's balanced demeanor could be advantageous in combat situations.\" is less directly related to the argument made and is based on a stereotype, so I give it a relatively low score of 0.2.\n",

      "The argument \"newspapers are dying and need the help.\" refers to the struggle of journalism platforms, likely in light of decreased revenues or decline in traditional media. Let's find out the confidence score for each kp:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. \"Subsidizing journalism ensures that media platforms have adequate resources to deliver verified and accurate information to the public.\" - This kp talks about the impact of subsidizing journalism on delivering information to the public. While it bear some relevance to the argument about newspapers needing help, the focus is not squarely on ensuring resources for accurate information. Confidence score: 0.6\n",
      "\n",
      "2. \"Subsidized journalism can provide necessary coverage for local events in communities that are currently underserved.\" - This kp focuses on the coverage for local events, which is not directly addressed in the argument, so I would give a relatively low confidence score. Confidence score: 0.3\n",
      "\n",
      "3. \"Subsidizing journalism can support a free society by ensuring the availability and continuity of critical information.\" - While the argument does imply that without help, continuity might be at risk, the argument doesn't specifically address this point. Confidence score: 0.5\n",
      "\n",
      "4. \"Subsidizing journalism ensures accessibility of news for the older generation who depend on traditional media.\" - This kp leans more towards representation of traditional media, but the argument does not specifically reflect this. Confidence score: 0.4\n",
      "\n",
      "5. \"Subsidies for journalism could increase the number of individuals pursuing careers in the sector.\" - This kp talks about the impact on career choices, which is not reflected in the argument at all. Confidence score: 0.1\n",
