Among the provided KPs, none directly mention the comparison with clean water or it being a human right. However, the KP \"Global vaccination practices prioritize safeguarding children against life-threatening diseases.\" is somewhat related as it talks about the prioritization of vaccinations for children's health, which can be seen as an underlying reason why vaccination is considered highly effective. Thus, it is selected as the best match with a reduced confidence score due to the lack of an exact match on the points about effectiveness and human rights.\n",
